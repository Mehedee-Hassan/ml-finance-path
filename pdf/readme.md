In this example, a daily return of 0.0%
0.0% is close to the mean of the distribution, meaning it is the most likely outcome under our normal distribution assumption.


Hereâ€™s how we interpret this:

Since the mean return is 0.05%
0.05%, the probability density is highest around this value, with most daily returns clustering near this point.
For returns close to 0.0%
- 0.0%, which is very near the mean, we observe higher frequency or density.
- This implies that a return of 0.0%  (no gain or loss) is not unusual.
- The bell curve shape further suggests that returns close to 0.0%

- 0.0% are more probable than extreme positive or negative returns due to the symmetrical spread around the mean.

In financial terms, this tells us that small gains or losses are typical, with lower likelihoods of extreme returns unless we go beyond one or two standard deviations from the mean.
